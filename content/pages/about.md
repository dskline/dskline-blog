My love of development started at an early age. I was captivated with HTML and CSS in the 90s, and spent some of my
teenage years making terrible websites hosted on Geocities and Angelfire. I learned to program games in BASIC on my
TI-83 Plus during classroom downtime. In high school, I was finally able to take my first computer science class -
my group's class project was a Java servlet-rendered browser game based on Tron where up to four players could
play on the same keyboard. The game was rightfully given the name "Chaos". (it was even entered it into a local
college competition!)

I graduated Virginia Tech in 2012, with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Besides the main curriculum, I
took classes that would prepare me for a career in web development: Human/Computer Interaction, Web Application
Development, Web-Based Decision Support Systems, and Mobile Development (which was iOS Objective-C focused at
the time). One of my group senior projects was the construction of what is now
[Gobblerpedia](https://gobblerpedia.org/wiki/Main_page).

While studying, I worked behind the IT support desk at the main campus University Bookstore and helped manage a
used book seller account on Amazon.

After college, I got a job as a full stack developer at Universal Service Administrative Company, a not-for-profit
organization in Washnigton, D.C. that helps healthcare providers, schools, libraries, and low income families get
access to internet service at an affordable cost.  I learned so much from the senior talent that (I guess) they
felt comfortable enough promoting me from an entry-level developer to a lead position after a few years. It's
still by far the most rewarding job I've ever had.

The Angular/React/Vue framework boom got me interested in re-pursuing my passion in front-end development. There
was really no better time to specialize in these new technologies, and so I jumped into a lead front-end position at
the Chronicle of Higher Education, a popular U.S. journal for university faculty. I was able to put my
self-training to the test, designing many JavaScript components and building an internal React site from the
ground up.

Eventually I settled in North Carolina, my current home. Just before the covid-19 situation, I worked at a
blockchain startup on a project called [Trust Your Supplier](https://www.trustyoursupplier.com), which is
currently improving the way suppliers and manufacturers do business with one another.

### What am I up to now?

Currently, small freelancing projects. Some personal projects that will hopefully gain some passive income.
Learning new technologies. Open to interesting remote work.
