## eslint-config-dskline
![ESLint](/media/heading/eslint.png)

My own ESLint configuration that I maintain for personal projects (but anyone can use it). My preferences include:

- StandardJS linting (no semicolons)
- Multiple React linting standards, including hooks
- Accessibility (a11y) best practices
- Browser compatibility warnings
- Import auto-sorting (`import React` at the top, followed by third party modules, followed by `/src` modules, and
then style)

## Blockchain Viewer
![Blockchain Viewer](/media/heading/blockchain-viewer.png)

An interview coding challenge that landed me a job. It's a dashboard that displays the latest blocks from the
[official blockchain API](https://www.blockchain.com/api).

- Built in two days with create-react-app (the pre-hook days of React)
- Material Design with mobile compatibility using CSS-in-JS
- Web Sockets refresh the latest displayed block automatically
