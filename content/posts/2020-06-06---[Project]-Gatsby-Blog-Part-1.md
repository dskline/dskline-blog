As a developer who has been in the business for just a few years, I often wondered if it made sense to create YADB
(yet another developer blog). After all, there are hundreds of ways to setup and deploy a free blog site and thousands
of developers who are already writing brilliant posts about the latest and greatest in tech.

Why should I spend 30 minutes of a day to write one blog post when I could spend that time creating something
else of value? Who's gonna spend 5 minutes reading my post when they could be reading the front page of
[dev.to](https://dev.to), or reading what Chris Coyier, Kent C. Dodds, and Steve Schoger have to say on Twitter? 

## Three reasons any developer should have a blog

despite how intimidating it might seem...

### To complete an idea

There's a great excerpt from [It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work](https://basecamp.com/books/calm), which describes
how difficult it is to stay on topic in meetings. Meeting times expire, interruptions happen, conflicts force people
to arrive late or leave early.

> When we present work, it's almost always written up first. A complete idea in the form of a carefully composed
> multipage document.  Illustrated, whenever possible. The idea is shared whole--there's no room to stop someone, no
> opportunity to break someone's flow.
>
â€” Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson of Basecamp

A blog post is useful because it conveys an author's idea in the way that the author originally intended. It can
be shared as a complete thought, and forwarded without any loss of context.

### Everyone learns differently

Too often we tell ourselves we're too dumb to understand a topic, and give up. We hire someone more knowledgable
than us to change our oil, or fix our sink, or install our smart home device. These things can all be learned, it's
just a matter of finding the right educational resource that connects with us and makes everything "click".

During a Q&A session on [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/), the hosts had a discussion about why we need more developer
blogs with an answer that resonated with me. All developers have been in this situation before: we need to fix some
issue with our code, Google gives us some options, and we have to go through a couple of different guides and
articles until we can fix the problem. I probably went through ten different beginner guides on Redux until I found
the right resource to make sense of actions and reducers.

Wes and Scott (Syntax.fm) say there's no such thing as having too many tutorials on one topic. Your tutorial could
be the one that finally clicks for that one developer (when all the others didn't).

### There's a lot of tech to discover in blogging

I'm a huge fan of new tech and libraries. Especially web development frameworks. Gatsby is one such framework that
developers can learn a lot from:

- Gatsby demonstrates the amazing benefits of statically generated HTML (performance, deployment costs, SEO)
- It gives you a better understanding of GraphQL and markdown
- Image optimization is top of the line
- It showcases a well-designed plugin and templating system

This site was generated from a popular blog starter called
[gatsby-starter-lumen](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/), and it is so packed
with features that I hadn't even considered when creating a blog:

- Automatic RSS generation! (the feed for this blog is [here](https://spencerkline.tech/rss.xml))
- PWA and offline caching out of the box (everything loads so fast)
- Disqus support (leave a comment on this post!)
- Great developer experience with SCSS, Jest, responsive pages, and markdown support for blog posts out of the box

I'm still looking through all the features, but you get the point. There's a lot of stuff involved in creating a
blog and you can improve your developer knowledge a ton (even if all the source code comes from a template project).

I'll explore more of the tech stack (including how to setup your own blog with Netlify CMS) in my next post. So
stay tuned!
