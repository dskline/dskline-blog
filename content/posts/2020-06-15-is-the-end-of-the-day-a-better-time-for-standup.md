Does your company hold daily standup meetings at the end of the day? If so, I'd love to hear what you think about them in the comments.

Today I went down a rabbit hole on the subject of the [afternoon slump](https://www.google.com/search?q=afternoon+slump), and I think all developers have noticed that their productivity begins declining a few hours after lunch. It got me wondering if maybe companies are wasting valuable "productive" time by scheduling progress report meetings closer to the beginning of the day.

Just to start a little debate with myself, I've decided to write down a few reasons an "end of work day" standup might be better than a "start of work day" standup.

### Advantage #1: Giving a progress report is not making full use of your brain's heightened cognitive function in the morning

This might not apply to some (i.e. extreme non-morning people), although studies show that the average person tends to make fewer mistakes and performs better on tests in the morning than in the afternoon.

Giving developers more free time to work in the morning may give their brain a competitive advantage for solving problems, and fewer bugs in your system.

### Advantage #2: Not having to wrack your brain remembering what you did yesterday, or before the weekend, or before a long vacation

In the morning, half of your brain is trying to pay attention to others while the other half is just trying to collect thoughts on what was accomplished the previous day. Valuable information can be missed or forgotten because of a few hours or days. After a long weekend or vacation, trying to remember all the things you did is like trying to remember the details of a dream you had.

In the evening, your work and impediments are still fresh in your brain, and you can start planning for your next work day without worrying about any stressful new surprises.

A **disadvantage** here is that a morning standup may be more beneficial for people returning from vacations, so they're back up to speed on what is happening and what they should be working on. On the other hand, playing catch-up may be better off done in a one-on-one setting.

### Advantage #3: It's less stressful coming into work when the day is already planned

Working at a fast-paced start-up, the only thing you could predict for sure was that every day was going to be unpredictable. In this situation, with a morning standup, every day is begun with a new problem. It can be stressful going into work not knowing whether this new problem is going to be an easy fix or a massive headache.

In an evening standup, you can be more prepared. You can either rest easy knowing exactly how you're going to tackle a problem, or you can spend some extra time preparing for those bigger issues.

### Advantage #4: Going off topic will happen less frequently

In the morning, nobody really cares about having lengthy off-topic conversations during or after standup because, in the moment, it feels productive. In reality, these conversations are unproductive to everyone except for those who are engaged.

In the evening, people will be eager to leave. Daily standup reports will stay short and focused. People will take a moment to ask themselves if a topic is important enough to discuss now or can be saved for this week's retrospective.

Rarely, a topic *will* need to be discussed by a few individuals in more detail while it's fresh in everyone's mind. I don't see this as a dealbreaker for evening meetings, but rather a good segue-way to another advantage. 

### Advantage #5: A way to bond with your coworkers on the way to the elevator, the car, or the bus stop.

After morning standups, some will stick around to chat about what's on their minds. Others, like myself, will feel the need to go straight back to being productive (and miss out on all that social currency).

Having standup at the end of the day would relieve any guilt someone might have about being social during work hours, and give them the freedom to chat about topics that interest them for as long as they want.

### Advantage #6: Nobody will ever be late

If you have a morning standup, you've probably had times where a few important people were missing. Maybe their alarm didn't go off, or they have to take care of a kid or pet. They don't have enough time to give a warning, leaving the rest of the group twiddling their thumbs for five minutes before they spend another five minutes figuring out how to dial the conference number.

With an evening standup, you can be sure you'll have a warning beforehand. Remember, 10 minutes multiplied by 12 people is 2 hours of paid company time.

And in case of emergencies, it's easier to type up a progress report for an evening standup than to type a report before an early morning standup.

### Advantage #7: Having a daily meeting in the afternoon will make meetings trend more to the afternoon

Some companies have more meetings than others, but what companies have in common is they usually schedule weekly and monthly meetings back to back with others (a good practice to prevent excessive context switching).

Complex morning meetings, in my experience, lead to afternoon follow-up meetings where half of the participants are still engaged and the other half are multi-tasking or daydreaming.

Having two three-hour meetings in a day can be draining, but if meetings are scheduled in the afternoon, then any necessary follow-ups will naturally fall on the next morning. That gives your brain enough time to recharge and digest the first half, and ready to give your full attention to the second.

### Advantage #8: So-and-so is out today, does anyone know what they worked on?

In morning standups, it's fair to say that nobody knows for sure what everyone worked on the day before, and therefore nobody asks. If they do, it would be a guessing game. Their work remains a mystery until they return, at which time it's less likely that they'll even remember.

Having an evening standup ensures that everyone who provided work for that day can give an update that the work is complete or unfinished. Those updates can be valuable information for a project manager wondering if targets can still be met, or if work needs to be reassigned.

## Evening standup meetings seem to be the way to go, so why aren't more companies scheduling this way?

It's likely due to a few reasons:

#### Differences in employee schedule

If a small number of employees work 7-4, but most employees work 9-6, you might say it's better to have standup at 9:00 when everyone can attend and, for the majority of employees, the meeting would not slice part of the day into two large chunks.

I would concede that having a short meeting at 3:45-4:00 could be a major workflow interruption. However, given that productivity starts to wind down in the middle of the afternoon, this could still be a worthwhile tradeoff. It could be a way to give developers a small "second wind" that focuses on getting a head start on tomorrow's work. Or it could be a way to press pause on the heavy work and wind down for some code reviews that can be merged, tested, and then deployed during offline hours.

#### Half days

Some companies let their employees go home early before holidays or special weekends, and therefore to ensure a daily meeting happens daily, you have to schedule it in the morning.

Is this a valid reason though? Would it be too much of an annoyance to reschedule standup to the new closing time? On the other hand, a reschedule could be a great way to "round up the troops" for a quick report that ends in team celebration and happy holiday farewells.

#### Easier to relay information to other team functions

One responsibility of your project manager might be to take information from standup and pass them onto other teams. If this information is given at the end of the day, the information might not be fresh enough in their brain the following day.

However, if 5-10 employees are currently carrying their own progress in their brains to the next day, then passing that responsibility onto one project manager might still be a good trade-off. I've worked with some wonderful project managers - they excel at taking notes.

#### But finally, perhaps the biggest reason...

## Morning may be the only option

Sometimes, you don't have a choice. Time zones will always be non-negotiable. For over a year, I woke up at 8:00 (or 7:00, depending on daylight savings) to report with our team in India.

I often wonder if there's a better way to conduct standups. The Agile Manifesto states that Scrum is a system of guidelines - companies need to adapt it to fit the needs of the project. The originators of the daily standup room likely weren't working with an international team over Zoom.

In a world where the whole team works remotely and on different work schedules, would a daily report work better in a readable format? Where team members contribute on their own schedules and is open for anyone else to read and comment on their own schedules? Or would this create more overhead than convenience?  Maybe that's a thought for another day, but I'm already seeing new projects on [Product Hunt](www.producthunt.com) that are tying to solve these problems.
